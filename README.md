# My Very First Webpage

Welcome! Check out my first webpage [here](https://adowlin.github.io/full-template/).

The website was built as part of my learning for a Full Stack Web Developer course with Code Institute.

## Project Description

The purpose of this site is to become familiar with development tools such as Git, GitPod, and GitHub - how to use them and how to write, manage, and deploy code. The webpage also displays the different technologies used throughout the Full Stack course.

## Technology

This project was written in HTML & CSS using GitPod, and is currently hosted on GitHub Pages.
